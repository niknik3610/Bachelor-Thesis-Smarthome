First section of your introduction. We would be surprised if there is
no citation to some literature, e.g.,
\cite{lulcs,PapacchiniCaminatiHu23}.

\section{Aims \& Objectives} \label{sec:intro:aims}
When researching available smart home technology, one major gap I came across 
was the availability of open source software. While options exist for someone 
interested in connecting their proprietary device to an open source platform 
(view \todo{find the link to this}), there was no solution for anyone looking to 
build their own device and then connect it to an open source hub. In fulfilling 
this goal, to build an open source platform for both devices and the hub they 
will connect to, there are multiple objectives that will need to be met along 
the way.
