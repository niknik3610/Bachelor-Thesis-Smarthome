\abstract{Put your abstract here. You should create a short abstract (200
words at maximum) which is on a page by itself. The abstract should be
a very high-level overview: for example 1--2 sentences on the aims of
the project, 1--2 sentences on the kind of design, implementation, or
empirical work undertaken, and 2--3 sentences summarising the primary
contribution or findings from your work. The abstract appears in the
front matter of the report: after your title page but before the table
of contents.}
