\chapter{Tables, Figures, and Referring to Them} \label{cha:chapter2}


This chapter shows simple ways of creating tables and figures. It also
provides examples on how to refer to them. The creation part is
relevant to those using \LaTeX{}, but how to refer to them and general
style comments are useful for everyone.

\section{Tables} \label{sec:chap2:tables}

There is a table here, Table~\ref{tab:table1}. Every table is numbered
based on the current chapter, and it has a caption providing a brief
explanation of the table. The numbering and captions are what is going
to appear in the List of Tables. For \LaTeX{} users, note also the [t]
next to {\tt begin\{table\}}, this will always put the table at the
top of the page.

\begin{table}[t]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{| c | l |}
    \hline
    {\bf Something} & \textbf{Something}\\
    \hline
    \hline
    Value A & Value B\\
    \hline
    Value C & Value D\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A very simple example of a table}
  \label{tab:table1}
\end{table}


\section{Figures}
\label{sec:chap2:figures}

Creation and general formatting of figures is similar to the ones for
tables. Look for example at Figure~\ref{fig:example1}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{lancaster-university-leipzig-logo}
  \caption{The university logo as an example figure}
  \label{fig:example1}
\end{figure}


Remember: as a rule of thumb, if you have a figure or table which is
not mentioned in your text, then either you do not need the
figure/table or some text is missing!


\section{Referring to Things}
\label{sec:chap2:referring}

Remember to always refer to chapters, sections, figures, tables,
\ldots correctly. That is, you might want to refer to something in the
former chapter by saying something like ``as mentioned in
Chapter~\ref{cha:intro} \ldots'', ``as mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec:intro:signposting}'', ``as it can be seen
in Figure~\ref{fig:example1}/Table~\ref{tab:table1}'', or ``more
detailed information can be found in Appendix~\ref{chap:A1}.
