\section{IoT System Architectures} \label{sec:chap2:servers}
Kamienski et al. describe a simple three layer architecture of an IoT system in
\cite{DesigningOpenIotSystem}. Within this architecture, the top layer is the 
"Input System", from which any data that will influence the decisions of the 
IoT system will come from. Included in this are sensors, but also user facing 
interfaces. The second layer, known as the "Process System", is where any 
algorithms are run and system behavioral decisions are made. The goal of this 
layer is to gain an "improved understanding of the system where the  data comes 
from" \cite{DesigningOpenIotSystem}. The bottom layer is the "Output System", 
which are where decisions made by the Process System will be enacted. This is 
often represented as the devices connected to the IoT system.

This three layer architecture is expanded upon by Bansal and Kumar within 
\cite{IotEcosystemSurvey}, where three more architectures are described which 
expand upon the ideas within the three layer architecture. They are however more 
specialized than the three layer architecture. The first of these is a 
"Middleware Based" architecture, which can take many forms, but is usually 
combined with another type of architecture, with a middleware layer. The 
different types are described in detail by Zhang et al. in 
\cite{MiddlewareIOTSurvey}. The second is known as a "Fog Based" architecture, 
where certain tasks, usually those with less processing requirements, are 
calculated on device to reduce latency. More computationally expensive tasks are 
however calculated on a server in the cloud \cite{IoTArchitectures}.

The most relevant architecture to this report is known as a "Service Based" 
architecture (SBA). The SBA is defined around the concept of the Service 
Oriented Architectural (SOA) style\cite{InteractingSoaBasedIot} of software 
design. SOA is defined by the Open Group Foundation as an "architectural style 
that supports service-orientation", where a service is a "logical representation 
of a repeatable business activity that has a specified 
outcome"\cite{SoaSourceBook}. Each service is a "black box" any device 
interacting with it. Other devices use interfaces and API endpoints to make 
requests to the service and receive a result. A SOA is comprised of many 
different services. In SBA, services are used to offer device functionality 
using interfaces, often using web based concepts such as SOAP or REST 
APIs\cite{TrustManagementSoaIot}. This allows devices with different 
capabilities and purposes to interact with the same system, allowing for an IoT 
system that is more flexible.
